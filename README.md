# mydata
I'm publishing some of my personal health and wellness tracking data, mainly to be used at the [Ultrahack](https://ultrahack.org/mydata2016/) event of the [MyData2016 conference](http://mydata2016.org/).

Take a look at the data available in the [slush2015](./slush2015) directory, analyze it, find correlations, compare data source accuracy, implement an algorithm that helps me keep my blood glucoses better under control. Send in your pull requests, all ideas are welcome!

Also, can you immediately think of all the risks involved in this kind of data sharing? Do you also see opportunities that access to this kind of data opens? Please send a pull request to lists in [risks](./scenarios/risks.md) and [opportunities](./scenarios/opportunities.md)!
