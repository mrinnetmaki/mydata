Data from my Dexcom G4 Platinum continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system (http://dexcom.com/).

The CGM measures my blood glucose every five minutes, so it's easier to see trends.
* How fast does a meal raise my blood glucose?
* How long does it take for a dose of insulin delivered from the pump to be effective?
* How do my blood glucose levels change during a soccer game?
* Does the hectic environment at the startup conference have an effect on my blood glucose?
* What happens during night time, when there are less external variables at play?

I've found the CGM to be really, really valuable in learning how to live with diabetes.
