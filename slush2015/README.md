I'm publishing this rich set of data to be used as one possible data source in the Mydata2016 Ultrahack hackathon (http://mydata2016.org/ultrahack/).

It would be awesome to see all this data visualized in fresh new ways.

Even better, it would be super cool if someone could find any correlations from the data.
* Does my electrodermal activity change when my blood glucose levels go up and down?
* What's the effect of my level of activity on my heart-rate variability?
* How should I adjust my insulin doses for the crowded and hectic conference, compared to everyday life?

Feel free to play with it!
