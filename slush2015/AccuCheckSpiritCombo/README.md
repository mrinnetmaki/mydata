This folder contains data from the insulin pump system I was using at the time, the Accu-Chek Spirit Combo (https://www.accu-chek.com/microsites/combo/why-accu-chek-combo.html).

In the data, you can see
* Blood glucose measurements from my glucose meter
* Insulin doses, both basal rates and boluses.
* My carb estimates that I've entered for the bolus calculator
* Entries for stress, illness, and activity that I've considered to have an effect on my insulin needs
* Pump events, for instance when I have refilled my pump

Unfortunately, Accu-Chek's Smart Pix software does not like the high pixel density of my laptop, and the reports are quite unreadable.
