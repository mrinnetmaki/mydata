The Moves app (https://dev.moves-app.com/) tracks my activity.

It recognizes when I'm walking, running, or riding my bike.

It can even tag activities automatically based on location, such as when I'm on a soccer field or at the gym, and not carrying my phone with me.

Keeping track of the location is helpful in other ways too. Looking at the data later, I can see where I've been at certain times of the day, helping me remember what may have happened then that has caused a change in my blood glucose levels (see https://github.com/mrinnetmaki/mydata/tree/master/slush2015/DexcomG4).
